# GKE vs AKS vs EKS

The three major cloud providers Google Cloud (GKE), Microsoft Azure (AKS), and Amazon Web Services (EKS) offer managed Kubernetes services with different features, pricing, and operational models.

This comparison highlights practical differentiators.

## Decision Guide (Pick by Scenario)

- **For minimal ops & fast iteration:** GKE (especially Autopilot) is the top choice. Its speed and managed experience are ideal for teams that want to focus on apps, not infra. 🚀
- **For Microsoft-centric & hybrid environments:** AKS provides the smoothest integration with Azure AD, Windows Server containers, and existing Azure investments. 🔗
- **For maximum control & deep ecosystem integration:** EKS is the most tunable platform, perfect for teams that need granular control over networking, security (IAM), and scaling within the AWS ecosystem. ⚙️

## Practical Notes

1. Start with whichever cloud your org already uses—network + IAM integration usually outweighs raw feature deltas.
2. Invest early in cluster autoscaling and right-sizing your nodes before considering multi-cloud migrations for cost savings.
3. Standardize your core add-ons. How you handle ingress (e.g., NGINX vs. a cloud-native load balancer), logging/metrics (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana vs. cloud-native tools), and secret management will differ subtly per provider. Choose a strategy early.
4. Keep version skew low; plan regular upgrades (quarterly). GKE often exposes new versions first; lag on others can impact feature parity.

## Quick Tip

Optimize cost first with proper node families, autoscaling thresholds, and rightsizing before switching providers. Operational consistency often beats minor price differences.
